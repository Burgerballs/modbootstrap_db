# ModBootstrap Official Database

An official database of mods you are able to download via ModBootstrap! Curated by burgerballs.

> [!WARNING]
> This DB is not useful yet. As ModBootstrap 0.4.0 isn't out yet, but once it is, you'll be able to download mods and pull request your own to the database!

You are able to make your own ModBootstrap DBs, but keep in mind that they will be recognized as unofficial, and a small warning will show up prior to the db list getting added to ModBootstrap.
